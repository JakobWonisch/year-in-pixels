## Development

To build a release version of the Android application create an upload key (".jks" file) using keytool (follow Tauri docs: https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/) and configure the relevant settings in `keystore.properties` (duplicate `keystore.properties.example` in same directory and rename).
